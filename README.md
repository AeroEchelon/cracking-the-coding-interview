## About ##

This repository contains solutions to ['Cracking the Coding Interview'](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)
by Gayle Laakmann. They are in no way the most efficient solutions or up-to-date as those solutions are already in the book.

Most of these solutions are my first 'crack at the code' before looking at the solutions provided by the book. Cheers!
