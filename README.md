## About ##

This repository contains my solutions to 'Cracking the Coding Interview' 
by Gayle Laakmann. They are in no way the most efficient solutions or up-to-date
as those solutions are already in the book.

Most of these are my first implementations before looking at the solutions of 
those questions. Cheers!

Marvin
